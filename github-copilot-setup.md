## GitHub Copilot Setup Instructions

This project is configured to work seamlessly with GitHub Copilot, the AI coding assistant that helps speed up development and improve code quality. The following instructions outline the recommended setup and usage practices for contributors using Copilot.

### Getting Started

1. **Enable GitHub Copilot**: Ensure you have an active GitHub Copilot subscription or access through your organization. You can sign up or verify your access at GitHub Copilot settings.

2. **Install Copilot Extension**: Install the GitHub Copilot extension for your preferred IDE. Supported environments include Visual Studio Code, JetBrains IDEs, Neovim, and others. Follow the official GitHub Copilot installation guide for your environment.

3. **Configure Repository Instructions**: This repository includes custom Copilot instructions to optimize its suggestions for our project structure and coding conventions. These instructions are stored in the `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file (located in the `.github` directory at the root of this repository) and are automatically used whenever Copilot assists you within this repository.

### Coding Standards and Best Practices

- Follow the style guidelines and conventions documented in this repository to ensure consistent code quality.
- Utilize Copilot suggestions as a starting point but review and adjust the code for correctness and project-specific requirements.
- **If project conventions or coding standards change, please update the `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file to ensure Copilot continues to provide relevant, high-quality suggestions.**
- If you encounter repeated undesired suggestions, update or request changes to the `.github/copilot-instructions.md` to improve context for the AI assistant.

### Getting Copilot Help or Giving Feedback

- If you need help with Copilot, have questions about its use in this project, or want to suggest improvements for the Copilot setup or instructions, please open a discussion or issue in this repository. The project maintainers will be happy to assist you!
