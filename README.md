## 🔬 Scientific Background

The name "Symphonic-Joules" reflects our mission to harmonize:
- **Symphonic**: The structured, harmonic nature of music and sound
- **Joules**: The fundamental unit of energy in physics

This project explores how musical patterns relate to energy patterns, how sound waves carry and transform energy, and how computational methods can reveal new insights at this intersection.
